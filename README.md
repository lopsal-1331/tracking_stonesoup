# Kalman Filter Notebooks (based on StoneSoup)

A collection of Jupyter notebooks inspired by the [StoneSoup tutorials](https://stonesoup.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1b9/auto_tutorials/02_ExtendedKalmanFilterTutorial.html), developed to deepen understanding and improve visualization of tracking systems through interactive simulations and practical examples.

## Contents

- Extended Kalman Filter walkthrough
- Linear vs Non-linear tracking examples
- Visualization of state estimation and uncertainty
- âš™Adjustable noise, time step, and motion models

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy
- matplotlib

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib notebook
```

Launch the notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
