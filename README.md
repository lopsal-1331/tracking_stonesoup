# tracking_stonesoup
A collection of Jupyter notebooks inspired by the StoneSoup tutorials, designed to deepen understanding and improve visualization of tracking systems through interactive, hands-on simulations. This project builds upon the concepts introduced in StoneSoup and extends them with custom implementations and visual tools.
